# Napari
Napari is an open-source Python library for visualizing multi-dimensional datasets. This allows for seamless integration with the commonly used scientific Python libraries (scikit-learn, scikit-image, Numpy, etc). 

The following script goes over the basics of using and interacting with the Napari Viewer and the use of three layer types: image, label, and point. The Napari Viewer is the GUI that allows users to interact and visualize their data. It is recommended to use jupyter notebook as the local host to execute the following script.
